# 1492: Revitalizing Languages

Languages are disappearing at an alarming rate; the linguistic rights of the speakers of most of the 6,500 languages are in danger of extinction. The Information and Communication Technologies (ICT) play a key role in preserving endangered languages; As the ultimate use of  ICT, it is worth highlighting natural language processing, since this century, the lack of such support hinders literacy and prevents the use of the Internet and any electronic medium. The first step is constructing resources such as speech corpus, monolingual corpus, bilingual corpus, dictionaries. These resources allow the construction of linguistic tools for natural language processing. Some tools such as automatic speech recognition (ASR), translators (NMT), Text-to-Speech (TTS), and others help break the language barrier and revitalize minority languages. However, it is important to know why these languages are in danger of extinction.

In Peru, 48 native languages are still alive but threatened. All these languages are in danger of extinction. Experts point out that the replacement process is irreversible unless disruptive policies and tools emerge (Adelaar, 2014). There are many computational tools for language processing within ICT and under The Human Language Technologies (HLT) label. Thus, computational linguistics should be highlighted as the tool potential for the revitalization of national languages, as the lack of this support prevents the growth of these languages and their productive use on the Internet (and in any electronic system). 

1492 is an open-source repository that aims to concentrate academics, independent scholars, organizations, communities, and individuals to revitalize and democratize the native languages in Peru. State of the art on sentiment analysis models
